In this notebook, I have put in practice all the classification algorithms that I have learned in the IBM Machine Learning with Python course.

I have used some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:


Linear Regression,

KNN,

Decision Trees,

Logistic Regression,

SVM,


We will evaluate our models using:


Accuracy Score,

Jaccard Index,

F1-Score,

LogLoss,

Mean Absolute Error,

Mean Squared Error,

R2-Score,


Finally, I have used my models to generate the report at the end.
